I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pan](https://gpantju.github.io/index/) of Visual Intelligence Lab from [College of Intelligence and Computing](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/), Tianjin University.
